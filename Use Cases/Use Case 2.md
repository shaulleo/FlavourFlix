## Description

The virtual assistant Filomena comprises a wide range of features. Namely, she provides with the possibility of getting to know a restaurant without ever leaving the house, by gathering a synthetic but rather complete description of the restaurant, including information about their average prices, cuisine types, restaurant style and much more.

This is possibilited by Filomena's ability of extracting the restaurant's name from the user input, preprocessing it, and sending it to an agent which performs a search operation of the restaurant within FlavourFlix' restaurant database. The latter may be found in the [Data Description](https://github.com/shaulleo/FlavourFlix/blob/main/Data%20Description.md).
