They were advised that it is impossible to pay over the phone and they would need to pay the £45 for afternoon tea. Luckily my god mother called me and I was able to speak to someone who advised “I’m not sure what to do I’ll just put it through as complimentary” however it’s not complimentary when i have already paid the money! It ruined the experience for them and put my already unwell grandmother under great stress.","Jessica L.","2","6","2023-03-25T14:30:00.000Z","4","5.5","Some sandwiches really dry and a lot more bun than filling.

The ambience was loud and feisty, lots of youngster about and not exactly a family-friendly place for a Saturday night. Music was repetitive and more suited for a club than a restaurant. The toilets (especially for my boys) were a state given the young (drinking) people about. Service was very busy and difficult to get hold of but helpful once we got their attention. I didn’t get what the hype was all about with this place.","Louise M.","6","10","2023-04-04T18:00:00.000Z","10","10","Excellent service! Great food.

Service was a bit lacking - our server needed to check (or be reminded) of everything we ordered - not in a breezy ""hey, let me check I got all that for ya!"" kinda way, but just more ""sorry, I wasn't really listening - did you say xxx?"".

We ordered pulled pork, and it had to go back as it was nowhere near warm enough - like every good Brit, I *never* send food back, but this was barely tepid when it arrived. Our brisket (and the replacement pork) were the perfect temperature, but they both tasted overly peppery - there was none of that delicious lip-licking juicy flavour, just dry and slightly hot black pepper aftertaste.

The pit beans were average too - they just tasted like baked  beans with shredded sliced beef mixed in. I know that's fundamentally what pit beans are, but the PBs at Red's have never been anything other than stunning.

The food was OK, and the cocktails we had were absolutely stellar, but for close to £60 (food only), we were pretty unimpressed.","Carlos F.","4","10","2023-01-27T19:30:00.000Z","10","10","Friendly staff and amazing food, cooked to perfection. 
Home of the American staples. 10/10 will be back very soon to enjoy more of that “melt-in-your-mouth” brisket!","Steven S.","10","8","2023-01-23T17:00:00.000Z","8","8","Staff were friendly and welcoming . Restaurant clean and tidy. Food was tasty but bit salty, and over priced £12.50 for chicken burger than extra for fries don't know why they don't just charge £15 and its a meal.","Katie S.","8","4","2023-01-21T20:30:00.000Z","8","5.5","The food was good enough but the service was horrendous. The staff were generally unfriendly and unhelpful, it took over 30 minutes for our drinks to arrive and numerous items ordered were forgotten by the staff and after pointing this out, there was no resolution other than to accept a refund for these items. 

In general as customers we felt ignored and not well looked after.","Aaron L.","2","8","2023-01-03T17:00:00.000Z","10","9","Food was beyond good.......................................................................................................","Alex V.","8","8","2022-12-30T18:00:00.000Z","6","7","Burgers and sides were great!
