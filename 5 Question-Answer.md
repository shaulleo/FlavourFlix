<h1> üîç Can you describe me the portuguese gastronomy?</h1>

Portuguese gastronomy is characterized by rich, filling, and full-flavored dishes. It is closely related to Mediterranean cuisine. In the 15th century, Portuguese explorers discovered new and exotic fruits, nuts, spices, and plants from the new land, which influenced the cuisine. Olive oil is widely used in Portuguese cooking, both for cooking and flavoring meals. Spices and herbs such as garlic, parsley, and coriander are also commonly used. Portuguese cuisine often features casseroles, grilled fish and meat, stews, salads, rice, and potatoes, which are often accompanied by the famous Bacalhau dish. Portugal also emphasizes fresh options, such as freshly caught sardines, slowly cooked wild boar, and locally sourced suckling pigs. Traditional Portuguese dishes are made from simple ingredients, based on regional produce, with a strong emphasis on fish. Portuguese recipes are known for their use of a wide variety of spices, including piri piri, vanilla, cinnamon, and saffron. Portuguese cuisine is influenced by India, Africa, and Spain, which sets it apart from nearby Mediterranean countries. The southern part of Portugal has been influenced by Moorish and Arab cultures, which is reflected in the use of fig sweets and almonds. Additionally, sweet pastries and fresh fish and shellfish are popular in Portuguese cuisine.
