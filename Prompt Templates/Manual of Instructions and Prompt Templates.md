## Motivation

As a group, and being this our first interaction with implementing and leveraging LLM's to build a virtual assistant, we acknowledge that Filomena may have some flaws, and that - as occurs for the all LLM's - producing quality prompts yields a higher possibility of having better responses.

For this reason, we considered appropriate to define a manual of guidelines to interact with the ChatBot, such that the user is able to have all their queries satisfied in a timely and efficient manner.


## Guidelines

### General


1.  In certain cases, such as producing restaurant recommendations, Filomena can become a bit slow to deliver their response. In this case, patience is key.

2.  When querying Filomena, the prompt should be concise and direct. The language may be either casual or formal, but slang should be avoided.
3.  The prompts should not be vague, but rather clearly explain the question being considered.
4.  Make only one request per prompt.
5.  Ensure there are no misspellings in your request.
6.  If the initial response is not perfect, ask folow-up questions or rephrase your input for better results.

### Questioning Based on Documents Retrieval

1. Specify what you are looking for with keywords directly linked to FlavourFlix.
2. Do not ask for things unrelated with FlavourFlix or the Portuguese gastronomic culture.
3. Use short sentences.
4. Avoid making multiple questions in the same prompt.

__Keyword Examples__

``` 
FlavourFlix; Food Personality; Founders of FlavourFlix; Analytics Dashboard; Current Location Feature; Portugal; ...;
````

### Requesting Restaurant Descriptions

1. Clearly state that you are looking for the description of a given restaurant.
2. Indicate clearly the name of the restaurant you are looking for.
3. In order to avoid confusing restaurant's names with people's names (e.g: "O Marinho"), identify that you are looking for a restaurant.

### Asking for Restaurant Recommendations

1. At first, state that you are looking specifically for a restaurant recommendation.
2. Filomena will then afterwards prompt you to indicate what exactly you are looking for, namely the location you desire, your food personality and other dining preferences.
3. Provide these inputs in a clear and concise manner such that it is quicker for Filomena to process them. 
4. The inputs should be provided all within the same prompt.
5. Filomena will now get you a recommendation, if the prior steps were sucessfull.
6. If you are not pleased with your restaurant recommendation, state that you are looking for a new restaurant recommendation and repeat the steps.
